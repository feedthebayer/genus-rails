    <p>
      I'm on a mission to fully unleash the potential of organizations and individuals and to propel them into their uniquely invigorating destinies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe organizations more fully benefit from their collective intelligence and creativity when left to function on their own instead of being controlled by one or more leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      For organizations, Genus is a tool for clearly visualizing and tracking roles, allowing the organization to easily map and communicate its internal relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
      For individuals, Genus is a thriving workplace that values wholeness and purpose far above financial gain, allowing its employees to not only be themselves but become who they never imagined.
    </p>

    <p>Join me in the journey. You'll never regret it!</p>
